# Solus Base

## What is this?
All this is, is just the "base" that Solus ran off of before it was shut down. It's been heavily stripped down from what it was, but contains all the essential functions.

## Why release it?
I'm only releasing this because after having seen the source code to various self-bots, it's geniuly sad how poorly made most of them are (Mainly React & Ghost).

## Support
For the most part, this will receive little to no attention from me as it's only a base that is meant to be worked with so don't expect updates.

You also won't receive any support on how to work with it from me. If you're even a remotely competent programmer, you'll understand how to use it properly.
